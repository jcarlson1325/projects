# Formatting Notes to Study with Obsidian (ft. Anki)

## Why take notes in this manner?

* Throughout my freshman year of college, I have tried several note-taking applications. While I knew hand-writing notes enabled better retention of information, I didn't have the heart to take all paper notes that will be rendered all but useless upon graduation. I was looking for an application that is compatible with both mobile and desktop operating systems that has some integrated studying system.
    
* I found the infinite scroll of Microsoft OneNote to be obnoxious and the lack of offline availability was a deal-breaker for Notion. While Logseq was much closer to what I was looking for, it was not as refined as Obsidian. After a few weeks of using Obsidian, I decided this is where I would set up my "second brain". Local storage in markdown files, flexible user interface, bidirectional linking, tags, more shortcuts than I could ever memorize, and *plugins* for features I didn't realize I needed.
    

## Available Plugins for Flashcards

* Of the available plugins, there were a few that converted my typed notes into flashcards. Two of these I have found to be the most useful are **Spaced Repetition** by *Stephen Mwangi* and **Flashcards** by *Alex Colucci*. Both allow the users to utilize one of a few simple syntax options to create flashcards that can be reviewed at different time intervals.
    
* The former resides solely within Obsidian, allowing the user to review flashcards, then select one of three options (the number of days until that card will appear again) depending on how confident you are with the answer. The latter integrates your notes with Anki, creating flashcard decks from your notes in a more comprehensive flashcards application. For this reason, I will be using the Anki plugin to take study for the CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ Certification.

## Notes Syntax for **Flashcards** Plugin

* I will be taking notes in the simplest form, question and answer separated by two semicolons within a bullet point. And maybe on occasion, I will add an extra semicolon to reverse the question and answer. Clean and simple.

* Much of the syntax between the two plugins is shared, with some minor formatting differences.
